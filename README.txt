Usage Instructions
------------------

Linux instructions:
To run this program, unzip our project. Change directories
to our project directory (the directory containing main.py).
Then, enter

python main.py <file1> <file2>

in the command line, where file1 and file2 are the file
paths to the two sequences to be tested.


Windows instructions:
Follow the same instructions as the Linux instructions,
however, use the name of the python script you have installed
(mine is python27). We've tested with absolute file paths
in double quotes, because my directory names had spaces in them.
